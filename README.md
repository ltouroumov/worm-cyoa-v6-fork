## Self Hosting

This CYOA uses viewer from the **ICC Neo** project, also created by Lt Ouroumov.

If you are interested in self-hosting this CYOA, you can find the viewer and the guide on how to host it in the [ICC Neo repository](https://github.com/ltouroumov/cyoa-editor).

## CYOA Tools (python scripts)

This repository also contains python scripts for working with the CYOA project files. You can find the documentation for using them easily as CLI tools in the [cyoa/README.md](cyoa/README.md) file.

> [!NOTE]
> The scripts are not generic and are tailored to the specific needs of this CYOA.
> There will be no special support for other CYOA projects.
> The scripts are provided as-is and without warranty of any kind.
